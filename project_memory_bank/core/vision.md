# Project Vision

## 🎯 The Mission
To transform LLM resource estimation into a professional **Strategic Deployment Planner**. We empower Infrastructure Teams and AI Architects to transition from experimental models to production-grade deployments by providing high-density, physics-backed hardware sizing for massive open-source models (70B+).

## 🚀 The Strategic Inflection Point: 70B+ Parameters
The tool focuses exclusively on the **70B to 700B parameter range**.
*   **Why 70B?**: This is the threshold where deployment shifts from "hobbyist/single-GPU" to "enterprise/infrastructure challenge."
*   **Why Cap at 700B?**: To maintain production focus, excluding experimental ultra-large models that aren't yet viable for standard enterprise infrastructure.

## 🏢 Target Personas
1.  **The Enterprise Architect**: Planning multi-node clusters for sovereign AI deployments (DeepSeek-V3, Llama 405B).
2.  **The AI Product Manager**: Matching model capabilities to viable hardware pricing for server + software bundles.
3.  **The ML Researcher**: Analyzing architectural efficiency (MoE vs Dense) and memory bandwidth bottlenecks.

## 🔄 The "Deployment Journey" UX Pattern
Our navigation flow mirrors the real-world procurement cycle:
1.  **Discovery**: "What models are viable?" → **Model Browser** (Vendor & Tiered views).
2.  **Estimation**: "What specific resources are required?" → **Sizing Engine** (Calculator).
3.  **Validation**: "Will this specific hardware configuration work?" → **Hardware Hub**.
4.  **Persona Scenarios**: "How does this look for my team?" → **Deployment Guides**.

## 🛡️ Non-Negotiable Pillars
*   **Open-Source Only**: Focus on models deployable on private infrastructure.
*   **Privacy-First**: Zero-telemetry, 100% browser-local computation.
*   **High-Density Metrics**: Prioritizing **Memory Bandwidth (GB/s)** and **Tokens/Second** over raw TFLOPS.
*   **Bilingual by Default**: Full English/Chinese support for global infrastructure teams.
