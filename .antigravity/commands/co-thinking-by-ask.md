Read the spec file I specified and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool/ask_question tool about literally anything: 
technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but makesure the questions are not obvious.
Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete and crystal clear. 
You should update the spec immediately after each round of interview if any new decisions are made. Otherwise, just keep interviewing me.
