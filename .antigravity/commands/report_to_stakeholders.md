Now let's say we are going to introduce the whole system to the stakeholders of our company. So we need to write a simple document to introduce the main features and strengths of our project, as well as the system architecture, main components of the system.

Though the stakeholders has general tech background, but he doesn't have much time and he only pays attention to the core techniques, system architecture, and the values the system can deliver. So we don't need to mention implementation details.

Also, when you mention about the strength, just be authentic, don't brag too much or using marketing/sales tone.

Now please write the whole report into @ ------------.  

Use mermaid charts whenever you can to simply the understanding.

Use Chinese to write the whole document.
